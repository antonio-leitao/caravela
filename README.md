# Optimizables
1. Code Tree
    - [ ] Study tree structure or how to iterate fast
    - [ ] Consider inverted file
    - [ ] Linked list? Tree seems the best though (hash tree?)
    - [ ] Partial hashmap should be enough though
    - [ ] No need to point to parent to it might be easier
1. N-Simplex construction
    - [ ] Rethink first vector
    - [ ] Optimize Amplitude
    - [ ] Study midpoint
    - [ ] Consider loadings? (this has effects on query too)

2. Query method
3. Quantization
